As Daniel H. Pink explains in his new and paradigm- shattering book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does--and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation: a) Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives; b) Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and c) Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references (p.

The embodied effects of selected retrofits were then calculated using the ATHENA Impact estimator and a list of environmental summary measures produced.  A method of combining operational and embodied effects based on these eight summary measures was proposed and the functioning and sensitivities of the equation were explored.  The method is preliminary and incorporates two factors, a weighting factor and building science factor, that require further research.  Analysis of the simultated results allowed generalizations about energy performance and prioritized retrofit recommendations for archetypes.  In most retrofit cases operational energy dominates, however, the ranking equation shows the potential for certain conditions in which the embodied effects determine the ranking of a retrofit."]]],["590"," "," ",[["a","Preservation copy in microfiche (4 sheets) held in the Ryerson Archives: ID no.

In Games of Empire, Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter offer a radical political critique of such video games and virtual environments as Second Life, World of Warcraft, and Grand Theft Auto, analyzing them as the exemplary media of Empire, the twenty-first-century hypercapitalist complex theorized by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. The authors trace the ascent of virtual gaming, assess its impact on creators and players alike, and delineate the relationships between games and reality, body and avatar, screen and street. Games of Empire forcefully connects video games to real-world concerns about globalization, militarism, and exploitation, from the horrors of African mines and Indian e-waste sites that underlie the entire industry, the role of labor in commercial game development, and the synergy between military simulation software and the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan exemplified by Full Spectrum Warrior to the substantial virtual economies surrounding World of Warcraft, the urban neoliberalism made playable in Grand Theft Auto, and the emergence of an alternative game culture through activist games and open-source game development."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Video games"],["x","Social aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Video games"],["x","Economic aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Capitalism"],["x","Social aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Imperialism"],["x","Social aspects."]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","De Peuter, Greig."]]],["830"," ","0",[["a","Electronic mediations ;"],["v","v. 29."]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b20318236"],["b","main6"],["c","-"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","110322"],["d","m"],["e","b"],["f","-"],["g","0"]]],["910"," "," ",[["a","tg"]]],["945"," "," ",[["l","main6"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"01951nam a2200349 a 4500","fields":[["003","OCoLC"],["005","20110201120345.0"],["008","100604s2010    abc      c    001 0 eng  "],["016"," "," ",[["a","20109035062"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781551952642"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","1551952645"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NLC"],["b","eng"],["c","NLC"],["d","CaOTR"]]],["043"," "," ",[["a","n-cn---"]]],["050"," ","0",[["a","PS8107.G6"],["b","M45 2010"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Meier, John H.,"],["d","1956-"]]],["245","1","4",[["a","The John H.

The paradox is a symptom of a far deeper dilemma - of accepting the idea of \"ecology without nature.\" That is, to have a properly ecological view, we must relinquish, once and for all, the idea of nature.\" \"Developing a vocabulary for reading \"environmetality\" in both content and form. Morton shows that representations of nature inevitably become metaphysical. Ranging widely in eighteenth- through twentieth-century literature, philosophy, culture, and the arts. Morton explores the value of art in imagining environmental conditions for the future. In short, the idea of nature has served much the same function in the modern period as the aesthetic has - that of healing what society has damaged; but as a result, unrealistic expectations have developed.\"--Book jacket."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Environmental literature"],["x","History and criticism"],["x","Theory, etc."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","English literature"],["x","History and criticism."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","American literature"],["x","History and criticism."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Ecology in literature."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Environmentalism"],["x","Philosophy."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Nature in literature."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Philosophy in literature."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Romanticism."]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b21182577"],["b","main9"],["c","-"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","120509"],["d","m"],["e","b"],["f","-"],["g","0"]]],["910"," "," ",[["a","jf"]]],["945"," "," ",[["l","main9"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"02740cam a2200445 a 4500","fields":[["003","OCoLC"],["005","20120417120829.0"],["008","120125s2012    nyua     bc   000 0 eng c"],["015"," "," ",[["a","GBB209693"],["2","bnb"]]],["016","7"," ",[["a","016020038"],["2","Uk"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9780870708121 (hbk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","0870708120 (hbk.)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ocn775028551"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","(OCoLC)775028551"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","UKMGB"],["c","UKMGB"],["d","MMX"],["d","YBM"],["d","YDXCP"],["d","NPL"],["d","MOF"],["d","ERASA"],["d","VVP"],["d","VP@"],["d","ZCU"],["d","OSU"],["d","MUUd"],["d","CaOTR"]]],["042"," "," ",[["a","pcc"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","TR647"],["b",".S468 2012"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","779.092"],["2","23"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Respini, Eva."]]],["245","1","0",[["a","Cindy Sherman /"],["c","Eva Respini ; with contributions by Johanna Burton and John Waters ; [edited by Kate Norment]."]]],["260"," "," ",[["a","New York :"],["b","Museum of Modern Art :"],["b","Distributed in the United States and Canada by Artbook/D.A.P.,"],["c","2012."]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","264 p. :"],["b","ill.

What emerges is a strong feeling for the character of the man as well as for a remarkable career in British cinema. The book will appeal to admirers, researchers and students alike.

The result is a colourful kaleidoscope of thought-provoking, critical and refreshingly non-mainstream analysis of hierarchy and bureaucracy. The chapters range from minute accounts of a single case to broader historical analysis, from the 'classical' journal paper to essay-style elaborations. The first section provides fundamentals and historical accounts of bureaucracy, highlighting negative and positive effects of bureaucracy and a differentiated picture with some future outlook. The second section focuses on the analysis of organisational, cultural and socio-psychological aspects of hierarchy and bureaucracy by interrogating hierarchy in contemporary work via a new framework, exploring the cultural fantasy of hierarchy and sovereignty, and examining subordinates' challenges to organisational hierarchy. The final section comprises two chapters which provide some alternative views on, and alternatives to hierarchy.

Poverty and Social Exclusion in India focuses on social exclusion, which has its roots in India's historical divisions along lines of caste, tribe, and the excluded sex, that is, women. These inequalities are more structural in nature and have kept entire groups trapped, unable to take advantage of opportunities that economic growth offers. Culturally rooted systems perpetuate inequality, and, rather than a culture of poverty that afflicts disadvantaged groups, it is, in fact, these inequality traps that prevent these groups from breaking out. Combining rigorous quantitative research with a discussion of these underlying processes, this book finds that exclusion can be explained by inequality in opportunities, inequality in access to markets, and inequality in voice and agency.

How many poor people have been prevented from lifting themselves out of poverty? How many people, and how many children, have seen their personal growth and development permanently harmed because their families could not afford to buy food? Finally, what can countries do to respond to higher and more volatile food prices? Global Monitoring Report 2012: Food Prices, Nutrition, and the Millennium Development Goals examines these questions. It summarizes the effects of food prices on several MDGs, stressing that recent food price spikes have prevented millions of households from escaping extreme poverty. The report advocates using agricultural policy to orchestrate a supply response; deploying social safety nets to improve resilience; strengthening nutritional policy to manage the implications of early childhood development; and implementing trade policy to improve access to food markets, reduce volatility, and induce productivity gains. The report acknowledges that one size does not fit all and that the sequencing and prioritization of various policy initiatives depend critically on the initial situation a country or region finds itself in. It also discusses support by the international community. The world has met two global MDG targets well before the 2015 deadline. Estimates based on preliminary surveys indicate that the share of people living in extreme poverty in 2010 was half what it was in 1990. The world has also halved the share of people with no safe drinking water. The goal of gender parity in primary and secondary education is on track to be met in 2015, and the goal of ensuring that children everywhere, boys and girls alike, are able to complete primary school is nearly on track. But the MDGs closely linked to food and nutrition, particularly those that aim to reduce child and maternal mortality, are lagging.

Are the visions of \"alternative worlds\" built on ethics of sustainability, social justice, animal welfare and the aesthetic values of local food cultures and traditional crafts still credible now that these foods crowd supermarket shelves and other \"mainstream\" shopping outlets? This timely book provides a critical review of the growth of alternative food networks and their struggle to defend their ethical and aesthetic values against the standardising pressures of the corporate mainstream with its \"placeless and nameless\" global supply networks. It explores how these alternative movements are \"making a difference\" and their possible role as fears of global climate change and food insecurity intensify. It assesses the different positions around these networks from three major arenas of food activism and politics: Britain and Western Europe, the United States, and the global Fair Trade economy. This comparative perspective runs throughout the book to fully explore the progressive erosion of the interface between alternative and mainstream food provisioning. As the era of \"cheap food\" draws to a close, analysis of the limitations of market-based social change and the future of alternative food economies and localist food politics place this book at the cutting-edge of the field\"--"]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on online resource; title from digital title page (viewed on Nov. 05, 2012)."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Food industry and trade."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Food industry and trade"],["x","Moral and ethical aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Food supply"],["x","Moral and ethical aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Consumption (Economics)"]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","DuPuis, E.

With access to primary care providers increasing and a shortage of child psychiatric providers, collaboration between psychiatric, pediatric and family advanced practice nurses is essential to improving care for this vulnerable population. Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health: A Resource for Advanced Practice Psychiatric and Primary Care Practitioners in Nursing provides a practical reference to aid in this endeavor. Aimed at advanced practice nurses and graduate students in nursing, this book is divided into 4 sections addressing assessment, treatment, special populations, and special issues. Within these sections, each chapter includes state-of-the-art, evidence-based information about the most common issues faced by psychiatric and primary care practitioners alike. Chapters focused on disorders review clinical manifestation, etiology, nursing interventions, integration with primary care, and implications for practice, research, and education. Chapters focused on issues describe the linkages between the behavioral/psychiatric profile of the child and associated risk and management strategies.

of neoliberalism in Britain from the 1950s through to the financial crisis and economic downturn that began in 2007-8. It demonstrates that influential economists, such as F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman, authors at key British think tanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Centre for Policy Studies, and important political figures of the Thatcher and New Labour governments shared a similar conception of the consumer. For neoliberals, the idea that consumers were weak in the face of businesses and large corporations was almost offensive. Instead, consumers were imagined to be sovereign agents in the economy, whose consumption decisions played a central role in the construction of their human capital and in the enabling of their aspirations. Consumption, just like production, came to be viewed as an enterprising and entrepreneurial activity. Consequently, from the early 1980s until the present day, it was felt necessary that banks should have the freedom to meet the borrowing needs of consumers. Credit rationing would be a thing of the past. Just like businesses, consumers and households could use debt to expand their stock of personal assets. By utilizing the method of French philosopher Michel Foucault this book provides an original analysis of the policy ideas and political speeches of key figures in the New Right, in government and at the Bank of England. And it addresses the key question as to why policy-makers both in Britain and the United States did little or nothing to stem rising consumer and household indebtedness, instead always choosing to see increasing house prices and homeownership as a positive to be encouraged.\"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references and index."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Palo Alto, Calif."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["651"," ","0",[["a","Great Britain"],["x","Economic policy"],["y","1997-"]]],["651"," ","0",[["a","Great Britain"],["x","Economic conditions"],["y","1997-"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Neoliberalism"],["z","Great Britain."]]],["830"," ","0",[["a","Routledge frontiers of political economy ;"],["v","152."]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://ezproxy.lib.ryerson.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculryerson/docDetail.action?docID=10588952"],["3","View this book"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b23656438"],["b","webra"],["c","-"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","121127"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","-"],["g","4"]]],["900","2"," ",[["a","ebrary, Inc."]]],["910"," "," ",[["d","jf"]]],["945"," "," ",[["l","webra"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"03889cam a22004091i 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20121007104935.5"],["006","m||||||||d||||||||"],["007","cr||n|||||||||"],["008","121007s2012    enka    ob    001 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781139340120 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","1139338544 (electronic bk.)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp7641104"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ebr10558215"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"],["d","CaOTR"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","JZ5675"],["b",".S245 2012eb"]]],["245","0","0",[["a","Sanctions, statecraft, and nuclear proliferation"],["h","[electronic resource] /"],["c","edited by Etel Solingen."]]],["260"," "," ",[["a","Cambridge ;"],["a","New York :"],["b","Cambridge University Press,"],["c","2012."]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","1 online resource."]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references (p. 352-377) and index."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Part I.

Yet the effects of international sanctions or positive inducements on their internal politics remain highly contested. How have trade, aid, investments, diplomacy, financial measures and military threats affected different groups? How, when and why were those effects translated into compliance with non-proliferation rules? Have inducements been sufficiently biting, too harsh, too little, too late or just right for each case? How have different inducements influenced domestic cleavages? What were their unintended and unforeseen effects? Why are self-reliant autocracies more often the subject of sanctions? Leading scholars analyse the anatomy of inducements through novel conceptual perspectives, in-depth case studies, original quantitative data and newly translated documents.

Mechanical HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) in tall office buildings typically account for 30-40 percent of overall building energy consumption. The increased efficiency (or possibly even elimination) of these mechanical systems - through the provision of natural ventilation - could thus be argued to be the most important single step we could make in making tall buildings more sustainable. This guide sets out recommendations for every phase of the planning, construction and operation of natural ventilation systems in these buildings, including local climatic factors that need to be taken into account, how to plan for seasonal variations in weather, and the risks in adopting different implementation strategies. All of the recommendations are based on analysis of the research findings from richly-illustrated international case studies. Tried and tested solutions to real-life problems make this an essential guide for anyone working on the design and operation of tall buildings anywhere in the world. This is the first technical guide from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat's Tall Buildings & Sustainability Working Group looking in depth at a key element in the creation of tall buildings with a much-reduced environmental impact, while taking the industry closer to an appreciation of what constitutes a sustainable tall building, and what factors affect the sustainability threshold for tall\"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Natural ventilation."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Office buildings"],["x","Environmental aspects."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Tall buildings"],["x","Environmental aspects."]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","Salib, Ruba."]]],["710","2"," ",[["a","Ebooks Corporation"]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://www.ryerson.eblib.com/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_1075078_0"],["3","View this EBL ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b23816466"],["b","webl "],["c","i"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130107"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","i"],["g","0"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"02289nam a22004813a 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20121107100607.5"],["006","m||||||||d||||||||"],["007","cr||n|||||||||"],["008","121107s2012    nyua    ob    001 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","9780231526272 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","023152627X (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9780231156523 (cloth : alk. paper)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","0231156529 (cloth : alk. paper)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9780231156530 (pbk. : alk. paper)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","0231156537 (pbk. : alk. paper)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp7461751"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","D803"],["b",".H57 2012"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","940.53/1814"],["2","23"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Hirsch, Marianne."]]],["245","1","4",[["a","The Generation of postmemory"],["h","[electronic resource] :"],["b","writing and visual culture after the Holocaust /"],["c","Marianne Hirsch."]]],["260"," "," ",[["a","New York :"],["b","Columbia University Press,"],["c","c2012."]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","1 online resource."]]],["490","1"," ",[["a","Gender and culture"]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references and index."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Introduction -- Pt. 1.

Today, in a vibrant underground net-work of \"psychiatric survivor groups\" all over the world, patients work together to unravel the mysteries of madness and help one another re-cover. Optimistic, courageous, and surprising, Agnes's Jacket takes us from a code-cracking bunker during World War II to the church basements and treatment centers where a whole new way of understanding the mind has begun to take form. A vast gulf exists between the way medicine explains psychiatric illness and the experiences of those who suffer.

That is the subject of this volume. Laszlo Zsolnai writes that we should acquire the skill of gaining knowledge. Only then will we stand a chance of reacting to things that are improbable today, but could become a fact tomorrow. Also essential is the skill of designing, i.e., preparing actions conceptually in order to make decisions before irreversible changes occur. Finally, it is essential to master the skill of multidimensional judgment within the space defined by effectiveness, efficiency, and ethics.\" \"This volume represents Zsolnai's attempt to build a model for making ethical decisions both effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the model is much broader than a purely analytical framework. It must tell us how to act rather than limit us to reflection on actions already performed; it must combine decision and praxiological analysis of human conduct. The proposed model enlarges the scope of the debate and suggests new avenues of both rational and responsible decision making. This is an original statement on the crossover of policy and morality.\"--Book jacket."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Palo Alto, Calif."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Decision making."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Choice (Psychology)"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Ethics."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Praxeology."]]],["830"," ","0",[["a","Praxiology (New Brunswick, N.J.) ;"],["v","v. 16."]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://ezproxy.lib.ryerson.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculryerson/docDetail.action?docID=10363047"],["3","View this Ebrary ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b23883947"],["b","webra"],["c","-"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130122"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","-"],["g","0"]]],["900","2"," ",[["a","ebrary, Inc."]]],["910"," "," ",[["d","jf"]]],["945"," "," ",[["l","webra"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"02396cam a2200469 a 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20121213131346.6"],["006","m        d        "],["007","cr cn ||||||||"],["008","121213s2008    nyu     ob    000 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","9780823229543 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","0823229548 (electronic bk.)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp3170772"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"],["d","NhCcYME"],["d","CaOTR"]]],["041","1"," ",[["a","eng"],["h","fre"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","BD418.5.F7"],["b","M3513 2008eb"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Malabou, Catherine."]]],["240","1","0",[["a","Que faire de notre cerveau?"],["l","English"]]],["245","1","0",[["a","What should we do with our brain?"],["h","[electronic resource] /"],["c","Catherine Malabou ; foreword by Marc Jeannerod ; translated by Sebastian Rand."]]],["250"," "," ",[["a","1st ed."]]],["260"," "," ",[["a","New York :"],["b","Fordham University Press,"],["c","2008."]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","1 online resource."]]],["490","1"," ",[["a","Perspectives in continental philosophy"]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["546"," "," ",[["a","Translated from the French."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references (p. 83-94)."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Introduction.Plasticity and Flexibility - For a Consciousness of the Brain -- 1.

This scientific event was held from 13 to 15 September 2010 in Clermont-Ferrand. The conference attracted 90 participants from 14 countries from all over the world. The conference included 7 invited lectures, 19 oral presentations and 27 oral poster presentations. Moreover, before the scientific sessions, two postgraduate sessions were given in parallel every morning. The conference was divided in 6 sessions covering i) Data processing, ii)New developments/food system, iii) New developments/NMR, iv) Nutrition, v) Metabolomic and vi) Imaging. The book follows the form of the conference. This year's meeting corresponded to its 10th anniversary. The first international conference was held in 1992 at the University of Surrey in Guilford on Professor Peter Belton's and Professor Graham Webb's initiative. During the last 20 years, a lot of developments were performed and the next 20 years are also very exciting. This meeting presentations were focused on the new developments in NMR techniques : hardware as well software with metabolomic and imaging without the new applications of NMR tools in food of course and now in nutrition."]]],["521"," "," ",[["a","Scholarly & Professional"],["b","The Royal Society of Chemistry"]]],["538"," "," ",[["a","System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Food"],["x","Composition"],["x","Research"],["v","Congresses."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Magnetic resonance imaging"],["v","Congresses."]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","Belton, P.

To meet these challenges construction enterprises need to constantly seek new directions and business models in construction management. A number of tools, methods and concepts have been developed and advocated as aids to achieving improved performance, but many in the industry find them confusing or are sceptical of their relevance. The third edition of Construction Management: New Directions brings together, in a single volume, detailed discussion of a range of contemporary management concepts which are relevant to the construction industry, including strategic management; benchmarking; reengineering; partnering and alliancing; enterprise risk management; total safety management; total quality management; value management and constructability. It provides a straightforward, accessible and objective account of these concepts, showing how they interrelate and can be used to improve the performance of the construction firm.This research based text will be essential reading for industry leaders and practitioners, as well as researchers, postgraduate and senior undergraduate students.From a review of previous editionsI am in no doubt that this book will quickly become a favourite among students and practitioners alike --Construction Manager\"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["520"," "," ",[["a","\"This book brings together, in a single volume, detailed discussion of a range of modern construction management concepts, and provides an objective account of these concepts, showing how they interrelate and can be used to improve the performance of the construction firm\"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references and index."]]],["505","8"," ",[["a","Machine generated contents note: Preface to third edition Acknowledgments Chapter 1 The culture of the construction industry The book's contents References Chapter 2 Strategic Management Introduction Overview Strategic management process Strategic management in construction Paradoxes of strategic management in construction Developing and implementing strategy in construction Change management Linking operational actions to strategy using a balanced scorecard Stakeholder identification, analysis and consultation Strategic management in action -- a case study of Arup An integrated strategic management framework Conclusion References Chapter 3 Benchmarking Introduction Definition of benchmarking Historical development Types of benchmarking The process of benchmarking The benchmarking team Benchmarking Code of Conduct Legal considerations Benchmarking: the major issues Case studies Conclusion References Chapter 4 Reengineering Introduction Reengineering: what's in a name?

It examines a crucial period in the development of the English vernacular letter before Charles I's postal reforms in 1635, one that witnessed a significant extension of letter-writing skills throughout society. Early modern letters can only be fully understood by paying attention to the 'materiality' of the texts: in others words, to the physical characteristics of manuscripts as well as to the social contexts and material conditions in which they were produced, disseminated and read. This study aims to enhance our understanding of the process of early modern letter-writing in all its nuanced complexity, as it is traced from the preparation of epistolary materials and the textual production of letters, through their subsequent delivery and circulation, to the various ways in which letters were read and latterly preserved."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","List of Illustrations -- List

Global Networks: Design, Engineering and Operation guides the global industry and academia even further by providing an in-depth look at the current and developing trends, as well as examining the complex issues of developing, introducing, and managing cutting-edge telecommunications technologies. The author draws upon his considerable experience in the telecommunications industry to educate engineers designing equipment and systems on the hardware and software features essential to fault tolerant operation. He describes how to design networks that are fault tolerant and global in scope; how to identify best engineering and operations practices; and examines the role of technology labs in carrier networks. Software and hardware engineering practices are covered in depth. Hardware and software designs are explained with an emphasis on application and interaction of craft and operators with equipment and systems. The author proposes that equipment, systems and network designs should be integrated with the engineering and operations teams that run them. Practice, experience and a historical background are used to describe which designs and technologies fit which network services and applications. Global Networks is a complete and thorough assessment of the communications industry today, written by an author of international renown.Key features: Comprehensive treatment of the key theories and technologies associated with the design of modern communications networks, including equipment, systems and network design Coverage of equipment and software design, mobile networks, integration and the characteristics of large network outages Written in an accessible style and fully illustrated, it offers a complete and up-to-date picture of communications technologies from initial design through to application Includes a section on future challenges such as the Exabyte traffic growth and an assessment of the dual roles of IPV4 and IPV6 \"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["520"," "," ",[["a","\"Global Networks: Design, Engineering and Operation guides the global industry and academia even further by providing an in-depth look at the current and developing trends, as well as examining the complex issues of developing, introducing, and managing cutting-edge telecommunications technologies\"--"],["c","Provided by publisher."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references and index."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Machine generated contents note: pt.

This approach is based on kinetic models built from relatively simple mechanistic schemes but integrating physical processes (oxygen diffusion and stabilizer transport), and use property (for instance mechanical failure) changes.

New to this edition is coverage of polymer nanocomposites, and molecular interpretations of yield, e.g. Bowden, Young, and Argon. The book begins by focusing on the structure of polymers, including their chemical composition and physical structure. It goes on to discuss the mechanical properties and behaviour of polymers, the statistical molecular theories of the rubber-like state and describes aspects of linear viscoelastic behaviour, its measurement, and experimental studies.Later chapters cover composites and experimental behaviour, relaxation transitions, stress and yielding.

The central argument is that the change in Russia's positioning towards its neighbourhood, with Russia assuming an objective policy of engagement and influence, is evident in its most recent dealings in political, economic and security terms. The contributors to the volume agree that this has become increasingly evident after the events in Georgia in the summer of 2008. Nevertheless, this does not mean that Russia has unlimited influence in the area, a fact that is detailed throughout the chapters. The contributors assess this trend in Russian politics, looking at different areas of activity, such as energy diplomacy or political-military relations, as well as through different theoretical lenses, including a discourse-analysis approach, which is an add-on to the understanding of the dynamics that underline the complexity of these relations."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Introduction: Russia and its Near Neighbours; M.R.Freire & R.E.Kanet -- PART I: DETERMINANTS OF RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY -- Russia's Vital and Exclusive National Interests in the Near Abroad; R.Laenen -- Domestic Influences on Russian Foreign Policy: Status, Interests and Ressentiment; H.Smith -- Nationalist Grievance and Russian Foreign Policy?

Chomsky's devastating critique of this account of human language in the 1960s, resulted in a cease fire with human's allowed c̀ognitive minds' with more expressive machinery, and animals resigned to the graveyard of associations. As messy as all ceasefires, this one left some animal researchers thinking associationism as bad a theory for animals as for people. But the good effect was that there was a broad appreciation that no one discipline would understand the complexities of the mind, and their origins.

And in which countries and types of organization has most progress towards gender parity been made? This book provides an international comparative analysis of the trends and evaluates gender equality policy developments, including those focused on corporate governance, such as the use of gender quotas for board membership. It includes detailed analysis using new data from eight European countries strategically selected because of their different policy frameworks and trajectories with regard to welfare, employment and promoting gender equality: Norway, Sweden, Finland, the UK, France, Spain, Hungary and Slovenia. Developments in women's presence in top management jobs are considered in relation to the broader gender structuring of the labour market and political life. Policy debates and developments to redress women's under-representation in this arena are examined and evaluated and theoretically informed explanations are advanced, which emphasize the influence of national institutional settings and policy regimes, over and above market forces, even at this elite level of the employment hierarchy."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","Series Preface -- Funding Reference -- Acknowledgements -- Notes on Contributors -- Introduction; M.

researched extensively. What lacks in the current literature is any substantive comparative, cross-national research on media discourse on Islam, the war on terror and national identity, particularly focusing on television news - still the principal and most trusted source of information for most of the world's population. Focusing on British, French and Russian television news coverage of Islam as a security threat, the book synthesizes approaches from political science and cultural studies, providing the first comparative, interdisciplinary account of how television broadcasting integrates discourses on Islam into distinct, nationally oriented, representational systems. The authors assess how the transfer of Islam-related meaning across national media landscapes shapes, and is shaped by, those discourses."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","List of Figures and Tables -- Acknowledgements -- Introduction -- PART I: THE BROAD VIEW: PATTERNS AND PREOCCUPATIONS -- The Ten O'Clock News: Anxious Attention -- The Journal de Vingt Heures: A Degree of Detachment -- Vremia: Compliance and Complicity -- PART II: THE CLOSE-UP VIEW: SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES -- 'Islamic Extremism' and the Brokering of Consensus -- Television Genre and Islamist Terror -- The War on Terror as Intercultural Flow -- Commemorating 9/11: The Struggle for the Universal."]]],["504"," "," ",[["a","Includes bibliographical references and index."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Islam in mass media."]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","Flood, Christopher."]]],["710","2"," ",[["a","Ebooks Corporation"]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://www.ryerson.eblib.com/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_882578_0"],["3","View this EBL ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b24082600"],["b","webl "],["c","i"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130219"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","i"],["g","0"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"01689nam a22004091i 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20130210102958.0"],["006","m||||||||d||||||||"],["007","cr||n|||||||||"],["008","130210s2013    nyua    o     001 0deng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","0465033466 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9780465033461 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9780465014811 (hardcover : alk. paper)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","046501481X (hardcover : alk. paper)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp10001390"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","QA31"],["b",".B47 2013"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","516.2"],["2","23"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Berlinski, David,"],["d","1942-"]]],["245","1","4",[["a","The king of infinite space"],["h","[electronic resource] :"],["b","Euclid and his Elements /"],["c","David Berlinski."]]],["246","3","0",[["a","Euclid and his Elements"]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","1 online resource."]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Includes index."]]],["505","0","0",[["t","Signs of men --"],["t","An abstraction from the gabble --"],["t","Common beliefs --"],["t","Darker by definition --"],["t","The axioms --"],["t","The greater Euclid --"],["t","Visible and invisible proof --"],["t","The devil's offer --"],["t","The Euclidean Joint Stock Company --"],["t","Euclid the great."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Mathematics, Greek."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Geometry"],["x","History."]]],["600","0","0",[["a","Euclid."]]],["600","0","0",[["a","Euclid."],["t","Elements."]]],["710","2"," ",[["a","Ebooks Corporation"]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://www.ryerson.eblib.com/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_1121288_0"],["3","View this EBL ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b24082612"],["b","webl "],["c","i"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130219"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","i"],["g","4"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"01470nam a22003971a 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20130217101522.2"],["006","m||||||||d||||||||"],["007","cr||n|||||||||"],["008","130217s2013    njua    o     001 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","1118529669 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781118529669 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9781118352052 (pbk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","111835205X (pbk.)"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp10001650"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","TR860"],["b",".D63 2013"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","776.6"],["2","23"]]],["100","1"," ",[["a","Dobbert, Tim."]]],["245","1","0",[["a","Matchmoving"],["h","[electronic resource] :"],["b","the invisible art of camera tracking /"],["c","Tim Dobbert."]]],["250"," "," ",[["a","2nd ed."]]],["260"," "," ",[["a","Hoboken, N.J. :"],["b","Wiley ;"],["a","Chichester :"],["b","John Wiley [distributor],"],["c","c2013."]]],["300"," "," ",[["a","1 online resource."]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["500"," "," ",[["a","Previous ed.: San Francisco, Calif.;

Serious occultists, declaring themselves heirs of Hermes Trismegestius, published works fueling interest in spiritualism, astral travel, and spell-casting. Capitalizing on church concerns over the spread of devil-worship, Ľo Taxil propagated the stunningly intricate hoax of Palladism, declaring that the Freemasons had established in Lodges throughout the world a cult of Lucifer devoted to sexual debauchery and mass murder of the faithful. Disenchanted with religion that preached reason and moderation, fin-de-siecle Catholics turned increasingly toward mystical beliefs extolling the value of personal suffering that would help to hasten the fervently hoped-for apocalypse.

His image is that of a leader of men in the male political universe of late nineteenth-century France. Historians have largely ignored his intense relationship with his lover, Ľonie Ľon. This relationship was both personal and epistolary, their face-to-face meetings complemented by daily letters, of which some 1100 survive. Using this unpublished correspondence, A Political Romance offers a new perspective on Gambetta, focusing on his ten-year relationship with Ľon. Their partnership was political as well as passionate. Gambetta sought counsel from his 'wise Minerva' and building the Republic became their joint project. The letters also reveal the weight of contemporary gender expectations on the couple's thinking and behaviour and the social conventions that excluded Ľon from 'respectable' circles. Foley and Sowerwine use this fascinating correspondence to provide a richer portrait than Gambetta's previous biographers, introducing the unknown figure of Ľon and producing a unique glimpse into the political and cultural world of 1870s Paris."]]],["505","0"," ",[["a","List of Illustrations -- List of Maps -- Preface -- Introduction: 'What Admirable Pages!' -- PART I: YEARS OF HOPE, 1872-1877

One of the most distinctive features of Meta-geopolitics is its all-encompassing analysis of space power, security and geopolitical actors. In comparison with traditional geopolitical approaches, deeply grounded in geography, demography and economics, the Meta-geopolitics framework includes space and broadens the definition of space power to include additional state capacities like health, social, and domestic politics and environmental dimensions in its key components. This framework also enables a more comprehensive assessment of the strategic orientations of major state and non-state space powers and serves as a basis for the development of a new space governance model. This proposed space governance model employs a 'symbiotic realism' approach to international relations and a 'multi-sum' approach to global security that will enhance the space power potential of

It frames the process of becoming literate as a fluid process involving multiple modes of presentation, and explains these processes in terms of making maps of our social lives and ways of doing things together. For Deleuze, language acquisition is a social activity that we can only follow. Masny and Cole draw on Deleuze's thinking to expand the repertoires of literacy research and understanding. They outline how we can understand literacy as a social practice and map the ways in which becoming literate may take hold and transform communities. The chapters in this book weave together theory, data and practice to open up a creative new area of literacy studies and to provoke vigorous debate about the sociology of literacy."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Literacy"],["x","Philosophy."]]],["600","1","0",[["a","Deleuze, Gilles,"],["d","1925-1995."]]],["700","1"," ",[["a","Cole, David R."]]],["710","2"," ",[["a","Ebooks Corporation"]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://www.ryerson.eblib.com/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_1109768_0"],["3","View this EBL ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b2411585x"],["b","webl "],["c","i"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130225"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","i"],["g","0"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"02869nam a2200481Ia 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20121129081402.8"],["006","m     o  d        "],["007","cr cnu---unuuu"],["008","121119s2012    enka    ob    000 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781139569453 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","1139569457 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","1139573012 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781139573016 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781139235792 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","1139235796 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9781107609259"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","1107609259"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp10194856"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"],["d","NhCcYME"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","QA901"],["b",".M38 2012"]]],["072"," ","7",[["a","TEC"],["x","014000"],["2","bisacsh"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","532"],["2","23"]]],["245","0","0",[["a","Mathematical aspects of fluid mechanics"],["h","[electronic resource] /"],["c","edited by James C.

In Africa, for example, hydropolitics affect politics and policymaking at the local, national, and international levels. To investigate water politics, this unique work focuses on the issue transboundary water governance in Southern and Eastern Africa.    Based on extensive field research, it offers a comparative study of the Orange Senqu and Nile basins in Africa, arguing that both causal and behavioral factors (such as localization and trust building) drive the multi-leveled development of cooperative management norms and foster the creation of regional communities of interest.    The book combines theory, analysis, and fieldwork within the framework of Constructivism as well as a wide range of examples to identify and analyze the nature of norms in hydropolitics. By doing so, it will help shape the debate on how water conflict and cooperative governance should evolve and will interest anyone studying African politics, hydropolitics, and issues of development."]]],["533"," "," ",[["a","Electronic reproduction."],["b","Perth, W.A."],["n","Available via World Wide Web."]]],["588"," "," ",[["a","Description based on print version record."]]],["506"," "," ",[["a","Access restricted to Ryerson students, faculty and staff."],["5","CaOTR"]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Water-supply"],["x","Political aspects"],["z","Africa"],["x","International cooperation"],["v","Case studies."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Water-supply"],["x","Government policy"],["z","Africa"],["x","International cooperation"],["v","Case studies."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Water-supply"],["x","Political aspects"],["z","Orange River Watershed"],["x","International cooperation."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Water-supply"],["x","Political aspects"],["z","Nile River Watershed"],["x","International cooperation."]]],["650"," ","0",[["a","Water-supply"],["x","Government policy"],["z","Orange River Watershed"],["x","International cooperation."]]],["710","2"," ",[["a","Ebooks Corporation"]]],["856","4","0",[["u","http://www.ryerson.eblib.com/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_1078337_0"],["3","View this EBL ebook"]]],["907"," "," ",[["a",".b24116336"],["b","webl "],["c","i"]]],["902"," "," ",[["a","130225"]]],["998"," "," ",[["b","0"],["c","130225"],["d","m"],["e","n"],["f","i"],["g","4"]]]]},{"type":"marc-hash","version":[1,0],"leader":"03021nam a22004331a 4500","fields":[["003","NhCcYBP"],["005","20130224102637.5"],["006","m||||||||d||||||||"],["007","cr||n|||||||||"],["008","130224s2012    enka    o     000 0 eng d"],["020"," "," ",[["a","1781003912 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["a","9781781003916 (electronic bk.)"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","9781781003909"]]],["020"," "," ",[["z","1781003904"]]],["035"," "," ",[["a","ybp9458640"]]],["040"," "," ",[["a","NhCcYBP"],["c","NhCcYBP"],["d","NhCcYME"]]],["050"," ","4",[["a","HC412"],["b",".A855 2012"]]],["082","0","4",[["a","330.9504311"],["2","23"]]],["245","0","0",[["a","Asian responses to the global financial crisis"],["h","[electronic resource] :"],["b","the impact of regionalism and the role of the G20 /"],["c","edited by Jehoon Park, T.J.

The book details reforms in one such country; Kyrgyzstan, one of the more diligent nations in undertaking donor-guided reforms since its independence in 1991.

Blinder shows how the U.S. financial system, grown far too complex for its own good--and too unregulated for the public good--experienced a perfect storm beginning in 2007. When America's financial structure crumbled, the damage proved to be not only deep, but wide. It took the crisis for the world to discover, to its horror, just how truly interconnected--and fragile--the global financial system is.
