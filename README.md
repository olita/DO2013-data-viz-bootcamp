## Data Visualization Boot Camp | Digital Odyssey 2013

### Description

Brief introduction of data visualization concepts, brief introduction of [d3](http://d3js.org), and a walkthrough of three exercises using library datasets. 

### Exercise 1

The first dataset is a sub-section of metadata from a library digitization program. We explore this data using a [pie chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235) to visualize the number of items pertaining to each collection, and also show outliers. 

### Exercise 2

The second data is a selection of MARC data. We explore this data using a [histogram](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3048450) to: 1) show the portion of electronic vs. print over time 2) Subject growth over time 3) Number of a given format in a collection over time 4) Comparison with expenditures.
