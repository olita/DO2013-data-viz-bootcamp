## Data Visualization Boot Camp | Digital Odyssey 2013

### Description

Brief introduction of data visualization concepts, brief introduction of [d3](http://d3js.org), and a walkthrough of three exercises using library datasets. 

### Exercise 1

The first dataset is a sub-section of metadata from a library digitization program. We explore this data using a [pie chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887235) to visualize the number of items pertaining to each collection, and also show outliers. 

### Exercise 2

The second data is a selection of MARC data. We explore this data using a [histogram](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3048450) to do things like:

1. Show the distribution of material publication over time
2. Show proportion of materials by subject
3. Show number of items in a given format in a collection

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/olita/DO2013-data-viz-bootcamp.git`
2. `cd DO2013-data-viz-bootcamp`
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4. Check out Exercise 1, and Exercise 2.
5. If you think it should be better (it totally can!) fork! If you want to share back, give us a pull request.
