## Data Visualization Boot Camp | Digital Odyssey 2013

### Description

Brief introduction of data visualization concepts, brief introduction of [d3](http://d3js.org), and a walkthrough of three exercises using library datasets. 

The first dataset is a sub-section of metadata from a library digitization program. We explore this data to visualize the number of items pertaining to each collection, and also show outliers.
